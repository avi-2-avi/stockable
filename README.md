- **pnpm** `9.14.4` or later
- **CockroachDB** `24.3.6` (for local database testing)

Install CockroachDB locally:

# MacOS installation
brew install cockroachdb/tap/cockroach
```

For other platforms, check [CockroachDB Installation Guide](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v25.1/install-cockroachdb-mac.html).

   ```
2. Database setup:
  - Make sure to start running your cockroach database locally or in the cloud.
  - To run locally cockroach:
   ```bash 
      cockroach start-single-node --advertise-addr 'localhost' --insecure
   ```

3. **Backend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Copy `.env.local.sample` as `.env` and configure the environments missing.
   - Run the data loader:
     ```bash
     go run cmd/loader/main.go
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     go run cmd/server/main.go
     ```

4. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Copy `.env.local.sample` as `.env.local` and update API settings.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pnpm install
     ```
   - Run the development server:
     ```bash
     pnpm dev
     ```

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **AWS CLI** `2.11.11` or later
- **Terraform** `1.7.0` or later

Additionally, you will require a cockroach database in the cloud. You can populate it locally using the `go run cmd/loader/main.go` command.

### Move to the Terraform Directory
Navigate to the `terraform` directory in your project:
```bash
cd terraform
```

### Log in to AWS SSO
Run the following command to log in to AWS using SSO:
```bash
aws sso login
```
Ensure you have configured AWS SSO before attempting to log in.

### Create and Configure Key Pair
1. Go to AWS EC2 and create a key pair.
2. Save the key pair as an RSA `.pem` file in the `terraform` directory.
3. Change the permissions of the `.pem` file:
   ```bash
   chmod 400 stockable-test.pem
   ```

### Prepare Terraform Variables
1. Copy the Terraform sample variables file:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.sample terraform.tfvars
   ```
2. Open `terraform.tfvars` and fill in the required values.

### Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

### Apply Terraform Configuration
Deploy the infrastructure using:
```bash
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
```
This will create the required AWS resources. The output will provide the SSH command to access the EC2 instance.

### SSH into the EC2 Instance
Wait for about 5 minutes, then use the provided SSH command to access the EC2 instance:
```bash
ssh -i "stockable-test.pem" ec2-user@ec2-0-0-0-0-0.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

### Navigate to the Stockable Directory
Once inside the EC2 instance, move to the `stockable` directory:
```bash
cd stockable
```

### Run Deployment Setup Script
Execute the deployment setup script:
```bash
sh ./deploy_setup.sh
```

You will find in the output where the application is running.
